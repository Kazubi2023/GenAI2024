John: Alright, folks, let's tackle the issue with the data schema. It seems to be causing compatibility issues with the consumer API.

Sarah: I've been digging into it, and it looks like the problem stems from the way we're structuring the data on our end.

Michael: Yeah, I noticed that too. It seems like the current schema doesn't align with what the API expects.

John: So, what do you suggest we do about it?

Sarah: I think we need to reevaluate our data model and make adjustments to ensure compatibility with the API.

Emily: Do we have any insights from the API team on what specific changes they need from us?

John: Not yet. I'll reach out to them after this meeting to get more clarity on their requirements.

Michael: In the meantime, I can start working on a revised data schema based on our initial discussions.

John: Sounds like a plan. Sarah, could you also check if there are any relevant documentation or guidelines from the API team that we can refer to?

Sarah: Sure thing, John. I'll do that right away.

John: Thanks, Sarah. And Michael, as you work on the data schema, keep in mind any potential impacts on our existing systems.

Michael: Will do. I'll make sure to document any changes and communicate them to the team.

Emily: It might also be a good idea to coordinate with the testing team to ensure thorough testing of the new schema.

John: Agreed. Let's loop in the testing team and schedule a meeting to discuss our testing strategy once we have a draft of the revised schema.

Sarah: I'll take care of scheduling the meeting and informing the testing team about our plans.

John: Perfect. Let's aim to have a follow-up meeting later this week to review the progress and make any necessary adjustments.

Sure, Sarah. As discussed in the meeting, 
you will need to reevaluate the data model and make adjustments to ensure compatibility with the consumer API. This involves reviewing the current schema and identifying any discrepancies with the API's requirements. 
You should also consult with the API team to obtain specific guidance on the necessary changes. 
Once you have a revised data schema, you will work on implementing it and testing it thoroughly to ensure it meets the API's expectations.
