Sure, Sarah. Based on the meeting summary, here are the detailed action items for you:

1. **Check for Relevant Documentation or Guidelines from the API Team**
   - Your task is to review any available documentation or guidelines provided by the API team regarding their data schema requirements.
   - This documentation may include specifications, data models, or any other relevant information that can help us understand the expected data structure for seamless integration with the API.
   - If you cannot find any existing documentation, reach out to the API team and request any available resources or guidelines they can provide.

2. **Schedule a Meeting with the Testing Team**
   - Once Michael has made progress on the revised data schema, you need to schedule a meeting with the testing team.
   - The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the testing strategy for the new data schema.
   - Involve the testing team early in the process to ensure they are aware of the upcoming changes and can plan their testing efforts accordingly.
   - Coordinate with the testing team lead or manager to find a suitable time slot for the meeting and send out invitations to the relevant team members.
   - Prepare an agenda for the meeting, outlining the goals, the proposed changes to the data schema, and any specific areas that may require focused testing efforts.

3. **Inform the Testing Team about the Plans**
   - Before the scheduled meeting, provide the testing team with an overview of the plans to revise the data schema.
   - Share any relevant documentation or details about the proposed changes to help them understand the context and scope of the upcoming testing efforts.
   - Encourage the testing team to review the information and come prepared with any questions or concerns they may have.

By completing these action items, you will ensure that the necessary documentation and guidelines are gathered, and the testing team is involved early in the process. This will facilitate a smooth transition to the revised data schema and ensure thorough testing before implementation.
