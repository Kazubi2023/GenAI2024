Here is a summary of the meeting:
- The development team has made good progress on the initial build and is integrating the latest GENAI models. They are currently optimizing the algorithms for various scenarios.
- The data side of things is progressing well. A large dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed, and the team is fine-tuning the models for training. Initial tests will be run later this week.
- The UX design team has finalized the UI mockups and is working on the user flow. Interactive prototypes are being created for user testing. A call with the development team is scheduled for tomorrow to discuss technical details and support design requirements.
- QA has started drafting test cases based on the current build. Initial focus is on functionality and performance tests, with coverage of edge cases and user scenarios to follow.
- The product perspective includes meeting compliance requirements and planning a go-to-market strategy. A session to discuss compliance and marketing in detail is scheduled for next week.
- The testing phase requires sufficient server bandwidth, and extra resources have been provisioned if needed. The team will monitor resource usage and adjust as necessary.
- The meeting ended with thanks and a commitment to keep the momentum going.
