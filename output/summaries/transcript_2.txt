Meeting Summary:

The team met to discuss UI changes for the investment app in the wealth management system. Sarah expressed reservations about the proposed color scheme, suggesting it could clash with the brand identity and confuse users. Michael disagreed, arguing that the updated color scheme adds a modern touch and aligns better with current design trends. John proposed gathering more insights from the UX research team by conducting a survey to gauge user preferences regarding the color scheme. Before making a decision, John emphasized the importance of ensuring everyone was on the same page regarding the functionality of the investment app. Michael provided a brief overview, highlighting the app's portfolio management, performance tracking, and trade execution capabilities. Emily mentioned that stakeholders had requested additional features for the investment app, specifically integration with third-party financial news sources to provide real-time market updates and insights. John agreed and added this feature to the roadmap, planning to discuss implementation details in the next sprint planning meeting.

Action Items:

• Sarah will conduct a user survey on color preferences and present the results to the team.
• Michael will research potential integration options for the financial news feature and present his findings to the team.
• The team will reconvene next week to review the survey results and discuss progress on the new feature.
